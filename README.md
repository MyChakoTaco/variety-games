Fun Variety Games is a site dedicated to practicing React.js and other modern front-end development and UI/UX sensibilities, all while having a little fun with my friends.

The project is hosted on Google's firebase (Thank you free hosting!) deployed using Node.js npm (Node Package Manager), and handled by React.js.

My plan is to add a new game every couple of days with increasing difficulty to practice my algorithimic skills while also managing increasing state complexity. This project was designed so I can create components individually without having side effects to any other components.

Currently Available Games:
Tic-Tac-Toe

If you have any comments or questions, I would love to hear back! Just shoot me a private message or an email.
